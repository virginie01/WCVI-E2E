Incident solar radiation forcing data Qi_input: NARR daily values in 1992 (i.e. downward shortwave radiation fluxes).
Treated as a climatology as a first step. Can extend the time-series with year-specific conditions later on.   
Air temperature forcing data airtmp_input: NARR daily values in 1992 (i.e. temperature at 2 m above the ground).
Treated as a climatology as a first step. Can extend the time-series with year-specific conditions later on. 
Dew point temperature forcing data dewptT_input: NARR daily values in 1992 (i.e. dewpoint temperature at 2 m above the ground).
Treated as a climatology as a first step. Can extend the time-series with year-specific conditions later on. 
E-W wind speed forcing data uWndSpd_input: NARR daily values in 1992 (i.e. uwnd at 10 m above the ground).
Treated as a climatology as a first step. Can extend the time-series with year-specific conditions later on. 
N-S wind speed forcing data vWndSpd_input: NARR daily values in 1992 (i.e. vwnd at 10 m above the ground).
Treated as a climatology as a first step. Can extend the time-series with year-specific conditions later on. 
Local longshore wind stress data wndl_input: daily values given by Ze. Took the year 1997 from his longest time-series (1995-2002). 
Possible to calculate a longer forcing time-series with year specific conditions from NARR data (i.e. uwnd and vwnd --> U10. Tau=Cd*rhoair*U10)
Remote wind forcing data wndr_input given from Ze. Took the year 1997. Longer time-series from 1995-2002. Seems tricky to extend the time-series.
(i.e. Talk with Debby, some data are missing)
Mixed layer depth forcing data mld_input: daily values given by Ze. Took year 1997. Time-series available from 1995-2002. Debby and Ze are supposed to give me the code to
extend the time-series. (based on Ze's talk).
Entrainment rate data entrnmnt_input: daily values given by Ze. Took year 1997. Time-series available from 1995-2002. Debby and Ze are supposed to give me the code to
extend the time-series. (based on Ze's talk).
Initial temperature/salinity profiles for simulation t_input/s_input: World Ocean Atlas (WOA) January averaged decades. shelf=48.625;-125.625 (UL=0-30m;
LL=30-110m;Dem=110-120m)- Slope=48.625;-126.875 (UL=0-30m;LL=30-390;Dem=390-400). Averaged across depths. 
Lateral boundary temperatures LBtmp_input: Open ocean upper/lower layers from WOA, all months, decades including 2008, see paper sheet for 
further information (coordinates, depths, etc..). Interpolation in between 15 of each month. Rain T from air temperature from NARR averaged down to 700hPa (i.e website and see script).
temperature run-offs from "Stream Temperature Patterns in British Columbia, Canada, based on routine spot measurements".
Interpolation between 15 of each month. VICC temperatures from NARR surface temperature (see script).
Lateral boundary salinity LBsal_input: Open ocean upper/lower layers from WOA, all months, decades including 2008, see paper sheet for 
further information (coordinates, depths, etc..). Interpolation in between 15 of each month. Precipitation salinity=0. Run-off salinity assumed = 0. VICC salinity assumed = 32 (Debby's original
model)
